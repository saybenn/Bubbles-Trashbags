Bubbles & Trashbags was my first freelance project I landed while in Virginia. There isn't too much to say about the creation process, as the client was just looking to spruce up his pre-existing web page and since the project only required HTML and CSS. PHP was included in the original release for the sake of emails, but my understanding of code was novice level at this point in my journey. So, while I could put together something that worked, it was insecure and left the intended recipient's email plain for all eyes in the GitHub repo. I've since learned about Environment Variables, so it's defintely something laugh worthy now.
